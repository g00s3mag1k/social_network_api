## Description

This is a Social Network Api back-end server application. Insomnia helps with the server testing on the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE commands and comes into play by interacting with the server when there is no static webpage for front-end testing. This server is interactive when properly installed with Insomnia.

## Installation

Open integrated terminal under the server.js file in VS code, or a code editor of your choosing, and run 'npm i' before running the application. After that run the command 'npm run start' and you can test the server CRUD commands in Insomnia.
